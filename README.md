How to run tests.

pip packages that have to be imported:

webdriver-manager ( pip install webdriver-manager )
pytest ( pip install pytest )
selenium ( pip install selenium )
Running tests:

All tests are created to be able to run in one moment or separately, one by one. To run them all at once, move 
in terminal to /project directory and type py.test to run separately 
move to /project_directory/task_n/tests folder and use py.test command

pytest.ini file is configured so prints will be shown in the console.
